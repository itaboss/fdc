fdc - Fully Dynamic Connectivity
===========

Fully dynamic connectivity library for Monte Carlo Markow chain simulations on the lattice.

This library is a direct copy https://github.com/ermeel86/sweeny with the following extensions

* support arbitrary number of dimensions of the lattice (originally only 2)
* some runtime improvments
* added a dynamic number of counters for the individual lattice nodes
* added some basic observables
* refactoring
