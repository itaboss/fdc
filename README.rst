fdc - Fully Dynamic Connectivity
===========

Fully dynamic connectivity library for Monte Carlo Markow chain simulations on the lattice.

This library was cloned from https://github.com/ermeel86/sweeny with some additional refactoring applied.

The original library was also extended from 2 to arbitrary dimensions for a lattice.
